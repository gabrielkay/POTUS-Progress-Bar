# POTUS-Progress-Bar

A simple twitter bot that periodically tweets a progress bar of the percentage complete of the current president's term.

## Implementation

The bot is just this python script, uploaded to pythonanywhere.com and run once a day as a recurring task. The bot updates [this Twitter account](https://twitter.com/BarPotus).

## Creating a similar bot

Making your own python twitter bot can be very easy using this script as a template. First make sure you set up a python environment according to [requirements.txt](https://github.com/gabrielkay/POTUS-Progress-Bar/blob/master/requirements.txt). Then enter your own twitter keys/tokens from developer apps, make sure you authorize your program, then utilize the tweepy apis however you choose.

## Security Issues

I'm aware that old commits have twitter keys and tokens visable. Those commits were made while setting up the bot and once actually implemented, I reset the keys and obviously stopped including them in github.
